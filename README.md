# Coding Exercise: Simple Note-Taking App

Your task is to create a simple note-taking app using React Native. You can clone this repo or create your own using

```
npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```

# Features

1. **Note Input:** The app should provide an input field that allows users to enter a note.

2. **Add Button:** There should be an "Add" button. When this button is pressed, the app should clear the input field.

3. **Note Display:** The app should display all entered notes below the input form.

4. **React Native UI Components:** The app should be built using only React Native UI components.

5. **Separation of Concerns:** The business logic and state management of the app should be handled in a separate file. Similarly, all data storage-related logic should be in a separate file. The input field state can be stored anywhere.

6. **Styling:** Style the app similarly to the provided screenshot. Exact matching is not required. Feel free to add a bottom margin to achieve spacing between notes.
